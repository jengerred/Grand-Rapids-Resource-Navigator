# Grand Rapids Resource Navigator

A web application built to help low-income residents of Grand Rapids, MI, discover local resources through an interactive map and a custom AI chatbot. The project emphasizes accessibility, inclusivity, and support for the city’s significant Latino population.

## About the Project

**Grand Rapids Resource Navigator** was created to address the challenge of finding local resources, especially for those facing economic hardship and digital exclusion. The app provides a simple, map-based interface and a multilingual AI chatbot to guide users in both English and Spanish, making the platform more inclusive and accessible to the diverse Grand Rapids community.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Users can search for and view resources near them using a responsive map interface.
- **Custom AI Chatbot:** The chatbot, developed from scratch, answers questions and helps users navigate the app in both English and Spanish.
- **Multilingual Support:** The entire application, including the chatbot, is fully available in English and Spanish, ensuring accessibility for non-English speakers and the large Latino community in Grand Rapids.
- **Routing Assistance:** Integration with Leaflet.js and Mapbox provides accurate directions to resources.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Optimized for use on any device.

## How It Works

1. **Map Browsing:** Users explore available resources on an interactive map.
2. **Chatbot Guidance:** The AI chatbot provides real-time assistance, answering questions and offering navigation help in two languages.
3. **Directions:** Users receive step-by-step routing to resource locations.

## Tech Stack

## Inclusivity & Multilingual Support

The application was designed with inclusivity in mind, offering full support for both English and Spanish speakers. This feature is especially important in Grand Rapids, which has a large Latino population. The chatbot and all app content are accessible in both languages, helping to break down language barriers and ensure everyone can find the help they need.

## Resources

Currently, the app provides information and navigation for **food pantries**—many of which also offer other services. These are the primary resource type available at launch.

## Future Improvements

- **Resource Categories:** Add categories such as housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, education, and more to make it easier for users to find specific types of help.
- **Latino-Focused Resources:** Expand listings to include resources tailored for the Latino community, such as Spanish-language services and culturally relevant support.
- **Resource Submission Portal:** Allow community organizations to submit or update resource listings (user accounts will only be for organizations, not for general users).
- **Enhanced Routing:** Integrate speech-based navigation for improved accessibility.
- **Chatbot Upgrades:** Continue to improve the AI assistant’s conversational abilities and add proactive suggestions.

## Why This Matters

This project was built out of a commitment to **social impact**—helping low-income individuals in Grand Rapids find the support they need, when they need it. By combining modern web technologies, mapping, and AI, this application demonstrates both **technical skill** and a **passion for building solutions that matter**.
