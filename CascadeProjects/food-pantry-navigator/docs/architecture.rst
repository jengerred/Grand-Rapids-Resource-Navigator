Key Components
-------------

1. Data Collection Layer
   - ServiceFeeder: Collects data from various organizations
   - DataProcessor: Standardizes and cleans collected data
   - Database: Stores all service locations and information

2. Core Services
   - RouteOptimizer: Calculates optimal routes using OSMnx
   - DemandPredictor: Predicts service demand using ML models
   - LocationService: Manages geocoding and location data

3. Frontend Layer
   - Streamlit App: Main user interface
   - Map Integration: Interactive map using Folium
   - API Endpoints: RESTful API for external integrations

4. Infrastructure
   - PostgreSQL: Database for service information
   - Redis: Caching layer for performance
   - AWS S3: Storage for static assets
   - AWS Lambda: Serverless functions for data processing

Data Flow
---------

1. Data Collection
   - Organizations → ServiceFeeder → DataProcessor → Database
   - Scheduled data collection via cron jobs

2. User Interaction
   - User → Frontend → LocationService → Database
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

3. Route Optimization
   - User Request → RouteOptimizer → OSMnx → Map Integration
   - Cached results for common routes

4. Demand Prediction
   - Historical Data → DemandPredictor → ML Models → Predictions
   - Real-time updates based on weather and events
